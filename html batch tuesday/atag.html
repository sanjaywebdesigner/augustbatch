Unit 2: Programming Methodology (28 Theory + 10 Practical) Periods
General Concepts: Modular Approach, Clarity and Simplicity of Expressions, Use of proper names
for Identifiers, Comments, Indentation; Documentation and Program Maintenance; Running and
Debugging programs, Syntax Errors, Run-Time Errors, Logical Errors
Problem Solving Methodologies: Understanding of the problem, Solution for the problem,
Identifying minimum number of inputs required for output, Writing code to optimizing execution
time and memory storage, step by step solution for the problem, breaking down solution into
simple steps (modular approach), Identification of arithmetic and logical operations required for
solution; Control Structure- Conditional control and looping (finite and infinite).
Problem Solving: Introduction to Algorithms/Flowcharts.
